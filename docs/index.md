# **Airbnb App Documentation**

**Project Summary**

This case study project was undertaken during the <b>Data Masterclass Bootcamp</b> organised
by <b>Pfizer</b> and <b>Code.Hub</b> in the period of Sept-Nov 2022. The project involves building
a model that predicts the prices of an Airbnb listing in Athens. A RESTful API build with Flask is used to deploy the model and the UI of the app is based on the React library and its extensive ecosystem.
